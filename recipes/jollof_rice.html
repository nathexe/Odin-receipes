                <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp paprika (optional for smokiness)</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground white pepper (or black pepper)</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional, adjust to taste)</li>
                <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1-2 tablespoons sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>

            <p><strong>For flavor and protein (optional):</strong></p>
                <li>1-2 cups cooked chicken, beef, or shrimp (optional)</li>
                <li>1 cup frozen peas (optional)</li>
                <li>1 medium carrot (optional, diced or grated)</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the rice:</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wash the rice thoroughly under cold running water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
                    <li>Set aside to drain.
                    </li>
                </ul>
               <p> <li>Prepare the tomato sauce:</li> </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Blend the tomatoes, red bell pepper, and 1/2 of the chopped onion until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining chopped onions and sauté until soft and translucent (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Add minced garlic and ginger (if using) and sauté for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the blended tomato and bell pepper mixture. Stir well and cook for 10-15 minutes, allowing the tomatoes to break down and reduce. The sauce should thicken and become less watery.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato paste, thyme, curry powder, paprika, white pepper, cayenne pepper (if using), and bay leaves. Stir well, cover the pot, and let the sauce simmer for another 5-7 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, sugar (if needed), and more spices as desired.</li>
                </ul>

               <p> <li>Cook the Rice</li> </p>

                <ul>
                <li>Once the tomato sauce has thickened, add the rinsed rice to the pot. Stir well to coat the rice in the sauce.</li>
                <li>Pour in the chicken broth (or water), ensuring the liquid level is about 1 inch above the rice. If needed, add a bit more water to cover the rice. Stir in a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to low, and allow the rice to cook for 20-25 minutes. Check occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn at the bottom. If it seems too dry, add a little more water.</li>
                <li>After about 15 minutes, check the rice’s doneness. If the rice is almost tender but the liquid is still present, reduce the heat to very low and allow it to simmer in its steam for another 5-10 minutes. You can also fluff the rice gently with a fork to prevent it from clumping.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p><li>Add Optional Ingredients</li></p>

                <ul>
                <li>If you're adding cooked protein (chicken, beef, or shrimp), vegetables (peas, carrots), or any other additions, mix them into the rice during the final 5-10 minutes of cooking.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Serve</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Once the rice is fully cooked, remove the pot from the heat and allow it to sit for about 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with fried plantains, salad, or any side of your choice.</li>
                </ul>

            </ol>
